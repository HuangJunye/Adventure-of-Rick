# Adventure of Rick: Grad School

A tale of grad school inspired by Rick and Morty and my own PhD life. This is a JRPG style PhD student simulator game.

This was a submission for GBJAM7 made with GBStudio.

## Ideas
Learn from great RPG games like Pokemon, Zelda, Earthbound, Undertale, etc.

The story is about Rick when he went to grad school. The background of Rick and Morty allows any blizzard ideas. The goal of the game is to get PhD degree. To do that, Rick needs to complete various quests, such as selecting supervisor, passing qualifying exams, publishing papers, etc. Each of these quests can be a combat, WarioWare-like mini-game, side scrolling platformer or puzzle.

Perhaps I can make it a Zelda like open world adventure where you can challenge the final boss any time but you wonâ€™t be able to defeat so easily at the beginning. Rick gains experience, strength and superpower in the quests and he will finally be able to defeat the final boss: his supervisor.

The basic gameplay can be like this:

Do experiment to gain experience
Once you gather enough experience, try to publish a paper
Depending on the amount of experience, you will publish on different journals
But you still have chances to fail, the process is risky, and it takes time
Each paper you publish is going to be a super attack.

In addition, you need to complete your PhD degree within 4 years. I can introduce a calendar system where, for example, there is only 2 weeks in each month, 2 months in each year.

Average time to beat the game should be about an hour.
